## Problem

WPF is super awkward in PowerShell, it would be nice to be able to use powershell classes to work with it.

- Use commands to run code on Model (Command -> Model) - âœ” Done
- Notify UI when property is set. (Model -> UI) - Can be done by explicit call, but it would be nicer if we had setters for classes.
- Notify model when property is set. ( UI -> Model)
